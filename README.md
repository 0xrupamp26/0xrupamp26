<h3>GM GM, I'm Rupam Karmakar, a backend and smart contract engineer with a strong focus on shipping production-grade systems under pressure. My work spans smart contracts across Move, Solidity, and Rust, scalable backends in Node, Python, and Go, and full-stack Web3 integrations including indexers, relayers, and real-time event pipelines. I’ve won or placed at multiple national-level hackathons and consistently deliver complete, usable products instead of partial demos.<br></br>

I’m the Co-founder & CTO of [Klash](https://linktr.ee/KlashHQ), an on-chain Web3 opinion market where users trade on real-time Twitter controversies, and the Founder of [OutNeX Labs](https://linktr.ee/outnexlabs), a Web3 product studio that builds and launches end-to-end blockchain products by providing Hacker, Hustler, Hipster & Handlers to anyone who have an idea in this web3 space. <br></br>
I actively contribute within the Aptos and Base ecosystems, with hands-on experience in protocol-level thinking, security patterns, and infra design.</h3>

# Also, One More thing, I BUILD CAUSE I LOVE IT, TBVH!
