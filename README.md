<h1 align="center">GM, GM👋, I'm Rupam Karmakar</h1>
<h4>GM GM, I'm Rupam Karmakar, a Web3-first backend and smart contract engineer with a strong focus on shipping production-grade systems under pressure. My work spans smart contracts across Move, Solidity, and Rust, scalable backends in Node, Python, and Go, and full-stack Web3 integrations including indexers, relayers, and real-time event pipelines. I’ve won or placed at multiple national-level hackathons and consistently deliver complete, usable products instead of partial demos.<br></br>

I’m the Co-founder & CTO of Klash, a sentiment-driven, on-chain Web3 prediction market where users trade on real-time Twitter controversies, and the Founder of OutNeX Labs, a Web3 product studio that builds and launches end-to-end blockchain products by providing Hacker, Hustler, Hipster & Handlers to anyone who have an idea in this web3 space. I actively contribute within the Aptos and Base ecosystems, with hands-on experience in protocol-level thinking, security patterns, and infra design.</h4>

# I BUILD BECAUSE I LOVE IT, TBH!
